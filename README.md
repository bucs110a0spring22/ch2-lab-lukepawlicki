## SUMMARY:
 In Part A, the program uses data such as tuition, weeks of school, and classes to calculate some costs such as cost per week and cost per class. Part B selects a random object from a list that I created. 

## GRACE DAYS
Grace days used for this assignment: 0

Grace days remaining: 5/5

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 None

## REFERENCES:
None

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
 I included a string statement of "classes per week" when I printed the value and type of that variable. Just wanted to make it more clear that the 2 in the code was with that variable and not cost per week.
